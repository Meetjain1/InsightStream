1. **RFM Grouping**: Groups customers based on:
   - How Recently they purchased
   - How Frequently they buy
   - How Much Money they spend

2. **Customer Journey**: Tracks how customers behave over time from when they first joined

3. **Churn Reasons**: Finds the real factors that make customers leave

4. **Customer Value**: Shows how much a customer is worth to your business long-term

5. **Ask Your Own Questions**: Use simple SQL queries to answer specific business questions
