# Customer Business Analysis Dashboard

A powerful, easy-to-use dashboard for analyzing customer behavior, identifying segments, and preventing customer churn.

## Overview

This dashboard helps businesses understand their customers better and make smart decisions to keep them happy. It takes customer data, shows important patterns, and gives actionable advice that anyone can understand - no fancy statistics degree needed!

## Features

The dashboard comes packed with tools that make customer analysis simple:

- **See Your Data Come to Life**: Interactive charts that show customer patterns anyone can understand
- **Ask Questions Using SQL**: Run simple queries to dig into your customer data
- **Group Similar Customers**: Automatically sort customers into meaningful groups
- **Spot Why Customers Leave**: Find the real reasons behind customer churn
- **Get Plain-English Advice**: Receive clear recommendations anyone can implement

## Dashboard Pages

Our dashboard has four main sections:

1. **Data Explorer**: Look at your customer data in different ways and spot patterns
2. **Customer Groups**: See which types of customers you have and how they behave
3. **Churn Analysis**: Understand why customers leave and who's at risk
4. **Recommendations**: Get practical advice on keeping customers happy

## Architecture

The dashboard is built with a clean, modular structure that makes it easy to understand and extend.

## Analysis Methods Made Simple

The dashboard uses these business techniques, explained in plain language:

1. **RFM Grouping**: Groups customers based on:
   - How Recently they purchased
   - How Frequently they buy
   - How Much Money they spend

2. **Customer Journey**: Tracks how customers behave over time from when they first joined

3. **Churn Reasons**: Finds the real factors that make customers leave

4. **Customer Value**: Shows how much a customer is worth to your business long-term

5. **Ask Your Own Questions**: Use simple SQL queries to answer specific business questions
